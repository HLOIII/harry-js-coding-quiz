# Code Quiz

## User Story

As a coding boot camp student, I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores, so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

* When I click the start button, then a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question
* When I answer a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over
* When the game is over, then I can save my initials and score

Resources I used: I mostly used the information I was given from my class and I used "MDN Web Docs","W3schools", Google, Youtube.
